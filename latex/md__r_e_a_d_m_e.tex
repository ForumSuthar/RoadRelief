Thr project takes in sensor values and sends updates vida sms on timely basis.

step1\+: Processes sms\+System is created using Elma and it keeps updating the channel with sensorvalues It sends data serially to Twilio arduino Board.

step2\+: This data once received is sent to Twilio Iot account via broadband, through the sim card and antenna available on the kit.

step3\+: function created in Twilio Iot is Triggered once it receives command from the Twilio N\+B-\/\+Iot sim.

\subsection*{Milestoned Decided\+:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Importing Elma to arduino
\item Reading Data via Ultrasonic sensor
\item Sending Sms based on the Data from Ultrasonic Sensor
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Change of plans}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It was not feasible to import elma on Twilio arduino
\item Elma excuted via docker to send data serially to arduino
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Hardware to be used\+:}

Twilio Iot Development kit

\subsection*{setup}

\subsubsection*{Elma}

elma can be installed as directed here \href{https://github.com/klavinslab/elma}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/klavinslab/elma}} git clone the current repository


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git clone https://github.com/ForumSuthar/SmsUpdates.git}
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{Twilio N\+B-\/\+Iot}

You need the twilio development kit and sim card to use twilio N\+B-\/iot. The following provides detailed instruction of the Basic setup. \href{https://www.twilio.com/docs/wireless/tutorials/apn-configuration}{\texttt{ Twilio-\/account-\/setup}}

compile the arduino code given \href{https://github.com/ForumSuthar/SmsUpdates/tree/master/arduino}{\texttt{ here}} Upload it into the board once the setup is complete

Additional library used\+: Twilio Breakout library \href{https://github.com/twilio/Breakout_Arduino_Library}{\texttt{ Breakout-\/\+Arduino-\/\+Library}}

You can download this library and ad as Zip as follows\+: Open Arduino I\+D\+E-\/$>$ Sketch-\/$>$Include .zip library-\/$>$ the browse to given library and click OK

create a new function in Twillio account as given here \href{https://www.twilio.com/docs/runtime/functions}{\texttt{ Functions}}

add the Javascript code available \href{https://github.com/ForumSuthar/SmsUpdates/tree/master/Twilio}{\texttt{ here}} in the function created in Twilio App

\subsection*{Results}

\subsubsection*{Data from Elma}



\subsubsection*{Data from Arduino}



\subsubsection*{Sms Received}
